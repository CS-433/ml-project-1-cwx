# CS-433 Machine Learning Project 1

__Team Member__: Zewei XU, Haoxuan WANG, Ganyuan CAO


## Project Description
We implemented a machine learning model to recreate the discovering process of the Higgs particle with the data provided by ATLAS experiment at CERN. We implement several regression algorithms in our model. 

## File Description
* `main.py`: Use the functions in `implementation.py` to compute loss and last weight vector.

* `implementation.py`: Implement functions to compute gradient descent (GD), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), least squares, ridge regression, logistic regression, and regularized logistic regression. 

* `proj1_helpers.py`: Some helper functions for project 1

* `util.py`: Implements modules to crate deep neural network

* `Result.ipynb`: Used to show the results of cross validation of various models

* `run.py` :  Creates csv predictions submitted to the competition system

## Requirements
* Python 3.8.5 
* Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
* Numpy 1.20.3
